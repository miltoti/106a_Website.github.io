# 4. Results

## (a) How well did your project work? What tasks did it perform?

The project performed very well and successfully met all of its primary objectives. The UR7e was able to autonomously play Word Hunt by completing the full end-to-end pipeline, from visual perception and board interpretation to planning and precise physical execution. The system consistently detected the board, identified letters correctly, planned valid word paths, and traced words accurately on the iPad without damaging the screen or selecting incorrect letters.

In terms of gameplay performance, the robot achieved an average score of over 20,000 points, with peak scores reaching 30,000 points. These scores are considered high for Word Hunt and demonstrate that the system was not only functional but also effective at prioritizing longer, higher-scoring words within the game’s time constraints.

## (b) Illustrate with pictures and at least one video.
