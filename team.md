# 6. Team

(a) Include names and short bios of each member of your project group.

- **Brandon Huang**  
    Brandon is a computer science and data science major interested in computer vision. He has previous experience in computer vision through research projects and is interested in the intersection between robotics and computer vision.

- **Atri Shankar**  
    Atri is a Mechanical Engineering major interested in mechanical robotic design. He is well-versed in Solidworks and machine shop tools. He also has experience with mechanical design through various projects on an engineering club.

- **William Li**  
    William is an EECS major interested in the intersection of computer vision and robotics. He has had previous experience working with both robotics and computer vision projects.

- **Isaac Tsang**  
    Isaac is an EECS major interested in semiconductors and robotics. He is interested in working and applying the usage of robotics in real-life scenarios. 


(b) Describe the major contributions of each team member.

- **Brandon Huang**  
    Implemented the word search algorithm, which involved depth-first search (DFS) + backtracking and determining valid word paths. Also contributed to testing and refining the robot's sequence of movements in main execution loop.

- **Atri Shankar**  
    _TODO: add contributions._

- **William Li**
    Worked on the perception pipeline, implementing the ArUco tag localization, board detection and rectification, and letter inference using Qwen API. Also contributed to creating, testing, and refining the main execution loop of the robot.

- **Isaac Tsang**  
    Created the website for the final project presentation. Also contributed in testing and verifying the robot movements using markers, and eventually ensuring the robot can interact with the iPad safely without damaging the device.
